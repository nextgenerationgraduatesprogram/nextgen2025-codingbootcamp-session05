# NextGen 2025 Coding Bootcamp: Session 5

## :wave:

In this workshop we will explore how to interact with the filesystem using `pathlib`, reading files, and creating a dataset.

## :wrench:

If you're running this code locally please create a Python environment using the `venv` library using `python3 -m venv .venv`. Activate the directory `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux (or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows) and install the relevant libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Alternatively, you can use Google Colab to get up and running, the notebooks will install the relevants libraries as you run them.
